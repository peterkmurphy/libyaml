- &Œ± "A great philosopher once wrote"
- &Œ≤ "Naughty, naughty, very naughty"
- &Œ≥ "Ha ha ha ha ha üòÅ"
- &Ê±â "There's a guy in the place who's got a bittersweet face"
- &ËØ≠ "And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode"
- "His friends call him 'Ezeer and he is the main geezer"
- "And he'll vibe up the place like no other man could"
- "He's refined, sublime, he makes you feel fine"
- "Though very much maligned and misunderstood"
- "But if you know 'Ezeer he's a real crowd pleaser"
- "He's ever so good, he's Ebeneezer Goode"
- "You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious"
- "When he circulates amongst the people in the place"
- "But once you know he's fun, and something of a genius"
- "He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face"
- "Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards"
- "'Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in"
- "That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of 'Eezer"
- "As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin"
